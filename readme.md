# @stencil-community/postcss

This package is used in order to integrate with postcss and all of its plugins.

First, npm install within the project:

```
npm install @stencil-community/postcss --save-dev
```

Next, within the project's `stencil.config.ts` file, import the plugin and add
it to the `plugins` config. In the example below we're using the `autoprefixer` postcss plugin, so you'll also have to run:

```
npm install autoprefixer @types/autoprefixer --save-dev
```

This plugin requires Node.js 14 or higher. For older Node versions, see the 1.x release.

#### stencil.config.ts
```ts
import { Config } from '@stencil/core';
import { postcss } from '@stencil-community/postcss';
import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer';

export const config: Config = {
  plugins: [
    postcss({
      plugins: [autoprefixer()]
    })
  ]
};
```

During development, this plugin will use postcss to process any plugins you may
have passed along.

## Options

Postcss has an ecosystem of plugins itself (a plugin for a plugin if you will).
For our example, we're using the autoprefixer plugin, and configuring its
options. Note, you can pass any valid autoprefixer option.

```js
exports.config = {
  plugins: [
    postcss({
      plugins: [
        autoprefixer({
          overrideBrowserslist: ['last 6 versions'],
          cascade: false
        })
      ]
    })
  ]
};
```

### Inject Globals Paths

The `injectGlobalPaths` config is an array of paths that automatically get added as `@import` declarations to all components. This can be useful to inject variables, mixins and functions to override defaults of external collections. Relative paths within `injectGlobalPaths` should be relative to the `stencil.config.js` file.

```js
exports.config = {
  plugins: [
    postcss({
      injectGlobalPaths: [
        'src/globals/variables.pcss',
        'src/globals/mixins.pcss'
      ]
    })
  ]
};
```

Note that each of these files are always added to each component, so in most cases they shouldn't contain CSS because it'll get duplicated in each component. Instead, `injectGlobalPaths` should only be used for Sass variables, mixins and functions, but not contain any CSS.

## Valid file extensions

This plugin will only transpile files whose extensions are `.css`, `.pcss`, or `.postcss`.
